INTRODUCTION                                           *VimLint* *vimlint*

This plugin looks at your current Vim configuration and warns about
poorly set options that cause Vim to behave unexpectedly, incorrectly
or in a non-standard manner. Reasons are given for why something is
considered to be wrong, and suggestions are given as to how to rectify
the situation.

To run Vim Lint, use the command:
>
    :VimLint
<

This will create a |vimlint-report| in your temp directory and open it
in your current vim session for you to read.

VIM LINT REPORT                                           *vimlint-report*

The VimLint report shows the collected information about your Vim setup with
warnings and errors highlighted and marked with leading ! and !! characters
respectively. Warnings are shown in red on white background, whereas Errors
are shown in white on red background. To search for warnings and errors, use:
>
    /^!
<
The report is divided into the following sections:

- Version Information	Showing what version of Vim you are using and
			what features were enabled (+feature) or
			disabled (-feature) at compile time. If your
			Vim is missing an essential feature then you
			should upgrade to a more complete version if
			possible. See |:version| for more details.

- Essential Vim Options	Showing the most important Vim options. These
			options affect security, vi compatibility,
			standard Vim behaviour and interoperability.
			See |options.txt| and the |:options| command
			for more details.

- Environment Variables	Showing the value of several important
  			environment variables that Vim uses.

- Filetype Settings     Showing which of Vim's filetype detection, filetype
                        plugin and filetype indentation settings are
                        activated. In general, you will probably want all
                        three of these ON. To do that, add the following line
                        to your ~/.vimrc:
>
                           filetype plugin indent on
<

- Loaded Scripts	Showing all of the script files from builtins
			and plugins that were loaded in this Vim
			session. They are listed in the order they
			were loaded. See |:scriptnames| for more
			details.

- All Vim Options	Showing all of Vim's options with erroneous
  			and dubious options highlighted.

- Vim Termcap Options	Showing Vim's current terminal capability
			settings as read from terminfo when Vim was
			started. Though not helpful to beginners, this
			information might be useful to an expert
			debugging a terminal problem.

ISSUES                                                    *vimlint-issues*

More detailed explanation of features and options to explain why
something is bad. E.g. The vim help entry for |+X11| doesn't explain
that having it disabled will prevent cut/copy/paste between Vim and
other applications.

Several more heuristics are yet to be implemented for detecting
things, like 'behave mswin' being set.

The Scripts and All Settings options lists do not have a leading '!'
or '!!' for warnings or failures yet.

More entries need to be added to various Vim Options and Environment
Variables to make these checks more complete.
